again
you have to write 

step.1:
	git init 

step.2: 
	git status 
this step check what files unadd into the staging area
if not, you would see the filename with red 

step.3: 
	git add filenames
this step add the file into the staging area

Again you can use "git status to check what file store in the staging area
if yes, you would see the filename with green

step.4:
	git commit 
	
Ok, you would add the file into the repository
There are some problems when I would like to code git commit

Step.5:
	you can compare the modified version and original version 
	use
	" git diff" 
Step.6: 
	you can see who, when, what change the file 
	use " git log"
